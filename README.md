Blog pour d√©veloppeurs

This is the Project 5 work on Openclassrooms about creating a full blog in PHP . The object here is to present a functionnal blog and understand the comprehension of github. I chose to add a few more options about the blog, like the interface of a basic network in order to get something quite more beautiful to present.

The functionnalities are quite simple : a user page, profile page, edit user page and a blog functionnality, vut the objective is not only to be simple, but to be functionnal and people to see how i raised my objectives. Here is the link to the functionnal website !
